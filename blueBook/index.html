            <h2>High Level Description of Bluebook</h2>
            <p>
                For my final project, I made Bluebook– a website that adds a social aspect to Duke’s registration
                process. On BlueBook, Duke students can react to classes by liking, disliking, or adding them to their
                wishlist, comment and rate classes, add their friends, see the classes their friends have reacted to,
                and explore new classes based on subjects and course codes. Ultimately, BlueBook acts like a social
                network for Duke students, centered around the registration process. BlueBook differs from
                RateMyProfessor and other class ranking websites for a few reasons. First off, BlueBook is specific to
                Duke. The website is structured by the course credits, graduation requirements, and course offerings at
                Duke. Additionally, to react to and rate classes, users must have a valid Duke email, which minimizes
                the amount of spam on BlueBook. Finally, rather than viewing a general consensus of certain classes,
                users on BlueBook can view what classes their friends and peers have enjoyed, making the user’s
                experience personalized to their own Duke network and interests. BlueBook aims to help guide students
                through the registration process, so that, over their four years here, they can explore more of the
                courses and opportunities that Duke has to offer.

            <h2>High Level Description of How Bluebook Works</h2>
            <p>
                All data stored for Bluebook is stored in Firestore and that data is only accessed by Bluebook’s server.
                When a user loads any page of Bluebook, the front-end Vue pages fetch the data needed to render the
                current display from the server. When receiving requests for data, Bluebook’s server reads the
                appropriate data from Firestore, checks that the data is valid (meaning it contains all fields necessary
                for the front-end to work without crashing), processes the data and sends the JSON to the front-end to
                be displayed. All querying, filtering, and paginating of data is done by the server, allowing the Vue
                pages to simply display the data it receives. Whenever a user interacts with Bluebook in a way that adds
                data to Firestore (i.e. liking classes, rating classes, leaving comments, following users, changing
                their preferences etc.), the front-end Vue pages check that the user’s input is valid, meaning that it
                contains all the fields and values necessary to be stored in the appropriate Firebase collection, and,
                if so, the front-end sends the data to the server to be written to Firestore. This way, all user input
                validation is done in the front-end, before any invalid data reaches the server, and all JSON validation
                is done in the server, before any invalid JSON data reaches the front-end. Additionally, all reads and
                writes to Firestore are done by the server, allowing our server to edit any data in the database and
                return the updated data to the front-end. This keeps our front-end display consistent with the state of
                our database.

                    <a href='https://api-catalog.oit.duke.edu/apis/1'>Duke’s Curriculum API</a>. In order to retrieve
                    the information about Duke’s course offerings that fuels Bluebook, I pulled data from the Duke
                    Curriculum API, which provides JSON streams of data that contain various course details, including a
                    list of all classes, class synopsis, curriculum details and class sections, and loaded them into
                    Firebase. The Duke Curriculum API gives members of the Duke community access to the courses offered
                    at Duke. So, all data used for Bluebook is authentic, as it is pulled directly from Duke’s
                    Curriculum API. All other data used for Bluebook is inputted directly by its users.

                    data for Bluebook, I used Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication, along with their
                    documentations.
