            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p class="project-plan">
                For my final project, I plan to make a website that adds a social aspect to Duke’s registration process.
                I plan to
                call this website BlueBook– which touches on Duke’s mascot, the Blue Devils, and Duke’s registration
                system,
                bookbagging. On BlueBook, Duke students can add their friends, react to classes, see the classes their
                friends have
                reacted to, and explore new classes based on subjects, course codes, or popular classes. Ultimately,
                BlueBook acts
                like a social network for Duke students, centered around course offerings. BlueBook differs from
                RateMyProfessor and
                other class ranking websites for a few reasons. First off, BlueBook is specific to Duke. The website is
                structured
                by the course credits, graduation requirements, and course offerings at Duke. Additionally, to react to
                and rate
                classes, users must have a valid Duke email, which minimizes the amount of spam on BlueBook. Finally,
                rather than
                viewing a general consensus of certain classes, users on BlueBook can view what classes their friends,
                peers, and
                other people in their major have enjoyed, making the user’s experience personalized to their own Duke
                network and
                interests. BlueBook aims to help guide students through the registration process, so that, over their
                four years
                here, they can explore more of the courses and opportunities that Duke has to offer.
            </p>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
                To implement BlueBook, I will create the following pages and components, using Bootstrap and Vue:
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Home Page</b>
                <br>
                The home page will be a static page with the BlueBook name and logo. There will be 3 buttons on the home
                page. The “Login” button will take users to the Login page (described below). The “Sign Up” button will
                take users to the Sign Up page (described below). The “Continue as Guest” will take users to the explore
                page. Note, when a user is viewing the site as a guest, they will not have access to the Profile or Feed
                pages. Additionally, they will not be able to add friends, subjects, or react to classes unless they are
                logged into a valid student account. For the most part, the home page will be static, besides these 3
                buttons which will take users to the respective pages.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Login Page</b>
                <br>
                On the login page, users will enter their email associated with their account and their password. If the
                user enters a valid username in password, which we will authenticate with Firebase Authentication, when
                they hit the “Go” button, they will be taken to the Feed page. Note, the feed page will not be
                accessible by any users who have not logged in to valid accounts. If the user doesn’t have an account,
                they can click the “No Account? Sign Up” button instead, which will take them to the Sign Up page,
                described below.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Sign Up Page</b>
                <br>
                On the sign up page, users will enter their name, their Duke email, and their password. We will
                authenticate the Duke email address using authentication steps in Firestore (i.e. sending an email to
                their Duke email address to verify the email). Then, users will select their major(s), minor(s) and
                certificate(s) from a Select-Subject component, which will be implemented as a custom Vue component.
                This component will contain 3 drop down menus with subject names from the Subject collection of our
                database (described below) that users can select for their major, minor, and certificate. Their
                selections will be displayed in their profile under “Subjects,” as explained below. After filling out
                this information and pressing “Go”, users will be taken to the Feed page.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Feed Page</b>
                <br>
                The feed page will display a collection of “Reaction” components made by the user’s “friends”, which
                will be sorted in descending order by date. Everytime a user “likes,” “dislikes,” or adds a class to
                their “wishlist,” a reaction document will be added to our database and, as a result, the corresponding
                “Reaction” component will be added to the feed of all people who follow the user. So, each user will
                have a personalized feed of “Reaction” components made when their friends like, dislike, or add a class
                to their wishlist. “Reaction” components will include the following information:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The user’s name (who made the reaction)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The reaction type (i.e. “likes”, “dislikes”, “wants to take”)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Class-Reaction component (which contains the class name and has the appropriate background color
                    based on the reaction type)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A comment input (where the user can leave a comment for the reaction)
                </li>
            </ul>
            When a user clicks on any “Reaction” component, they will be taken to the corresponding “Reaction” page. The
            “Reaction” page is an expanded version of the reaction component that contains all the above information, as
            well as all of the comments left on the reaction.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>User Page</b>
            <br>
            The user page will contain the profile picture of the user and the name of the user. If the user is looking
            at their own User page, then the user page will not display an Add Friend button. If the user is looking at
            someone else’s User page, the user page will display an Add Friend button, if they aren’t currently friends,
            or a Remove Friend button, if they are currently friends. Under this, there will be 3 sections of the User
            Page, each implemented via a component.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Classes Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The classes section will contain 3 components: Liked-Classes, Wishlist, and Disliked-Classes. Each
                    of these components will contain a Class-Reaction component for each class that the user has liked,
                    added to their wishlist, and disliked (respectively). When clicking on any of these Class-Reaction
                    components, the user will be directed to the appropriate “Reaction” page, where they can view all
                    the comments for that reaction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Subjects Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The subjects section will contain a collection of Subject-Components. The size and the color of the
                    subject components will depend on the following. If the subject is the user’s major, then the
                    subject-component will be the largest. If the subject is the user’s minor or certificate, then the
                    subject-component will be medium sized. Otherwise, if the user has added the subject to their
                    profile via the Explore page, the subject-component will be the smallest. When clicking on any
                    subject-component, the user will be redirected to the Subject page, described below.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Friends Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The subjects section will contain a collection of Friend-Components for each person that the user
                    adds as a friend. Each friend-component will contain the name and profile picture of the “friend.”
                    When clicking on any friend-component, the user will be redirected to the User page for the
                    specified friend.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Explore Page</b>
            <br>
            The explore page will contain a search bar, which the user can type into, as well as 4 sections, each
            implemented via components. Note, the search bar will search within the selected section. So, if “People” is
            selected, typing “John” in the search bar will search for users named John.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Classes Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The classes section will contain a collection of Class components, which contain the class number
                    and class name. Clicking on any class component will take the user to the corresponding class page,
                    described below. If the user hasn’t specified any search terms, the classes displayed will be
                    recommendations made based on popular classes (search algorithm TBD, may include major / subject
                    interests if time permits it). Otherwise, only courses that match with the search term will be
                    displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Course Code Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The course codes section will contain a collection of Course-Code components. Course-Code components
                    contain a name, which represents the name of the course code, and a classes section. The classes
                    section will contain a collection of Class components that correspond with the course code. Only a
                    few of these classes will be displayed, followed by a “See More” button. By pressing the “See More”
                    button, users will be directed to the course code page for the appropriate course-code, which is
                    described below. If the user clicks on any of the classes displayed in the classes section, they
                    will be directed to the corresponding class page. If the user hasn’t specified any search terms, all
                    course-code components will be displayed. Otherwise, only course-codes that match with the search
                    term will be displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Subjects Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The subject section will contain a collection of Subject components. Subject components contain a
                    name. The size of the Subject components will be determined by popularity of Subject within the
                    BlueBook (i.e. how many students have added the subject to their profile). By clicking on any
                    subject component, the user will be directed to the corresponding subject page. If the user hasn’t
                    specified any search terms, all subject components will be displayed, sorted by popularity.
                    Otherwise, only subjects that match with the search term will be displayed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Friends Section</b>
                    <br>
                    The people will contain a collection of Friend components. Friend components contain a name and the
                    profile picture of the user. By clicking on any friend component, the user will be directed to their
                    corresponding User page. If the user hasn’t specified any search terms, all friend components will
                    be displayed, sorted by relevance to the user (according to their major, minor, certificate, etc.).
                    Otherwise, only users that match the search term will be displayed.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Class Page</b>
            <br>
            The class page will be displayed whenever a user clicks on a class component. Whether the user is logged in
            or not, on the class page, users can view the name of the class, the class number, a description of the
            class, and the course codes associated with the class (including cross-listings, modes of inquiry, and areas
            of knowledge). Users can also view the average “difficulty” level (out of 5 stars) and average “interesting”
            level (out of 5 stars) that students within BlueBook have rated the class. Finally, users will be able to
            view a comment section that includes any comments about the class left by student users.
            <br>
            <br>
            If a user is logged into a valid student account, on the course page, they will be able to leave a
            difficulty rating (out of 5 stars) and interesting rating (out of 5 stars) for the given course.
            Additionally, they will be able to click the “like” button, “dislike” button, and “wishlist” button for the
            class, which will add the class to their profile in the respective category, as well as create a reaction
            post that will display in their friend’s feeds. Finally, students can leave a comment for the class.
            Students can either leave anonymous comments or leave a comment with their name.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Reaction Page</b>
            <br>
            A reaction page will open when a user clicks on any reaction component, either from the feed page or a user
            profile page. A reaction page is an expanded version of the reaction component that contains
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The user’s name
                </li>
                <li>
                    The reaction type (i.e. “likes”, “dislikes”, “wants to take”)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A Class-Reaction Component (which contains the class name and, when clicked, takes the user to the
                    corresponding class page)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A comment section (containing all comments for the current reaction)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A comment input (where the user can leave a comment for the reaction if they are logged in)
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Course Code Page</b>
            <br>
            The course code page will contain the name of the specified course-code (i.e. “Natural Science”) along with
            a class section that contains class components for all classes that match that course-code. When the user
            clicks on any class component, they will be directed to the corresponding class page.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Subject Page</b>
            <br>
            The subject page will contain the name of the specified subject (i.e. “Physical Education”) along with a
            class section that contains class components for all classes that are listed under that subject. If the user
            is logged into a valid account, then an “Add Subject” or “Remove Subject” button will appear under the class
            name, depending on if the user has added the subject to their profile. When the user clicks on any class
            component within the subject page, they will be directed to the corresponding class page.


            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            <p>
                In order to populate BlueBook with Duke classes, I will use the Duke Curriculum API, which provides JSON
                streams of data which show various course details. I’ve already requested and received an API key, so
                I’ve been playing around with the developer console in order to figure out the requests I need to make
                to get the information I need. In order to access the JSON data I need, I will make GET requests to the
                following endpoints:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>/curriculum/courses/subject/{subject}</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For each subject in the subjects variable in <a href="./subjects.js">subjects.js</a> (which I’ve
                    created based on the subjects listed in Duke’s registration website), I will make the above GET
                    request with each subject name in the list. The response JSON data will be formatted as seen in <a
                        href="./subjectResponse.json">subjectResponse.json</a>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the JSON response for each subject, we will retrieve the following information:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            subjectCode = data.ssr_get_courses_resp.course_search_result.subjects.subject.subject
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            subjectName =
                            data.ssr_get_courses_resp.course_search_result.subjects.subject.subject_lov_descr
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            classes =
                            data.ssr_get_courses_resp.course_search_result.subjects.subject.course_summaries.course_summary
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Then, for each JSON object in classes, we will retrieve the following values:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            courseID = classes[i].crse_id
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            courseOfferNumber = classes[i].crse_offer_nbr
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    Then, we will use each of these values in the below API GET request, to get information about each
                    class.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>/curriculum/courses/crse_id/{courseID}/crse_offer_nbr/{courseOfferNumber}</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For each class, we will make the above request, which will return the JSON data formatted as seen in
                    <a href="classResponse.json">classResponse.json</a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the JSON, we will retrieve the following information for each class, which we will store in our
                    database:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            subject = data.subject
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            catalog_nbr = data.catalog_nbr
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            description = data.descrlong
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            title = data.course_title_long
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            type = data.acad_career_lov_descr
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            components = data.course_components
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    For each course, we will store the Array course_codes calculated from:
                                    course_codes[i] = components[i].ssr_component_lov_descr
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once retrieving the JSON data listed above, we will populate our database (Firestore) with the subject
                and class data, as described below.
            </p>

            <h2>Data Structure</h2>
            <p>
                For my project, I will use Google’s Firestore to store data to support the app. Firestore stores
                collections of documents. We will create the following collections:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Users</b>
                    <br>
                    The users collection will contain a document for each user on the app. User documents will have the
                    following fields:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>uid</b>: each user will be given a unique user ID by Firestore
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>displayName</b>: name specified by user when creating an account
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b>certificates</b>: an array of subject codes for the certificates the user specifies when
                            creating an account

                        <li>
                            <b>subjects</b>: an array of subject codes for the subjects the user adds to their profile
                        </li>
