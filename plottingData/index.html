            The map below shows each country's megatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of energy per 100 people. 
            On the map, countries are classified by megatonnes of their carbon dioxide emissions, according to the key below. 
            The color of the icons, along with the size, depict the amount carbon dioxide that each country emits per 100 people. 
            To see each country's exact number of carbon dioxide emissions from consumption of energy and their population size, 
            hover over any of the pins below. By default, all countries that have carbon dioxide emission numbers in our dataset 
            are displayed on the map below. In order to filter countries by population size, select the population sizes below.
            <br>
            <br>
            From these pins, we can attempt to visualize how much each country contributes to our earth's carbon dioxide 
            emissions in terms of their population. Some may argue that bigger countries like the U.S. have more carbon 
            dioxide emissions because they have a larger population size. However, we can see that this isn't neccessarily 
            the case. By standardizing carbon dioxide emissions across population sizes, we can begin to understand each 
            country's impact and contribution to our current enviornmental crisis compared to others.
