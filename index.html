          target="_blank">Computer Science 290: Web Application Development</a>! 
          I'm from Los Angeles, California and am currently junior in the Class of 2022
          at Duke University. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and 
          a certificate in Information Science + Studies. I applied to Duke as a math major; 
          however, as a freshman at the bottom of Duke’s registration food chain, 
          I couldn’t get into the right math class. So, I decided to sign up for 
          Computer Science 101. Before that class, I had never considered myself a 
          “computer” person. Even though I began using computers at a young age, around 
          6 or 7, I saw them as a magical box I could play games in. So, I wasn’t quite 
          sure what to expect from Computer Science 101. However, after completing my 
          first coding assignment, I was hooked. I knew I had found my “thing”– something 
          that combines the systematic logic that I love about math with the creativity I 
          grew up with as an artist’s daughter. 
          <br><br>
          Since then, I’ve gained much more knowledge and experience in the Computer 
          Science world, as I’ve continued to pursue the major. I’ve written code in 
          Java, Python, SQL, Swift, C, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MIPS, and R. I’ve worked 
          on both a MacBook Pro and a Google Pixelbook. Outside of course assignments, 
          I like to write code for the clubs that I’m a part of on campus and for 
          projects I help out with; however, the majority of my programming is done 
          for school or work assignments. 
          <br><br>
          I’m taking this course to gain a better understanding of web development in a 
          project-based classroom setting. In doing so, I hope to solidify the bits and 
          pieces of information I know about web development. Ultimately, I want to feel 
          more comfortable and gain a fuller understanding of all aspects of web development 
          because I would like to go into the tech industry after college. Although 
          I’m not quite sure, I believe that large-scale web development requires more 
          than just one web developer. In order to create a dynamic web application, 
          some developers may work on the client-side code using HTML, JavaScript and 
          CSS in order to define the site’s layout and styling, while others may use 
          Java or other languages to write the server-side code. I think that web 
          development is a great skill to know, yet a skill that contains many different 
          layers– which I’m excited to learn more about this semester.

          <h2>Links</h2>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>I love <a href="https://www.apple.com/" target="_blank">Apple</a>!
            <ul>
              <li>The layout and design of Apple's website feels sleek, yet easy
                to navigate. The website design also reflects the feel of Apple products,
                stores, and brand as a whole, making the online browsing experience fun and intuitive.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I also like <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">Netflix</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>Netflix's website makes it easy to browse and preview movies and shows. The layout 
                is simple, intuitive, and entertaining. It's visually pleasing to browse through the 
                posters for each movie and show. Netflix's new autoplay feature also allows users 
                to view an instant preview for each option while browsing, without having to click on 
                anything. This improves the user's browsing experience.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I am always confused by <a href="https://www.zara.com/us/" target="_blank">Zara</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>Zara's website not only feels cluttered, but it is also difficult to navigate. 
                There isn't a prominent navigation bar, and the options in the navigation bar 
                don't make it clear to navigate the site. Beyond that, the layout in which they 
                display clothes isn't uniform. It contains blank spaces throughout
                the grid of options, making the it feel as though the site hasn't fully loaded.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>I'm unimpressed by <a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites" target="_blank">Craigslist</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>The design and layout of the Craigslist website isn't super impressive. It seems very trivial and minimalist. 
                There's nothing wrong with the webiste's functionality, but compared to the UI/UX experience of other websites, it's 
                pretty boring. I believe that good UI/UX design is important because there are so many sites out there to choose from.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Here's a tutorial for <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/oauth2.0/index.htm" target="_blank">OAuth 2.0</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>I saw that user authentication is a topic we will be focusing on in this class, which made me think of OAuth. 
                OAuth is an authorization protocol that allows users to share and access resources from another external site 
                without using their credentials. This could be a helpful way to integrate Facebook, Google, Github and 
                other services into our websites for the class.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Here's a helpful quickstart for <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart/" target="_blank">Firestore</a>.
            <ul>
              <li>Firestore is a great way to store data for your website. Google provides 
                a quickstart guide to get Firestore set up for your web application, as well as 
                detailed documentation and example code for JavaScript and many other languages.
